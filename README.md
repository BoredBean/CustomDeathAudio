# CustomDeathAudio
This simple mod supports a custom death audio.

It will play a custom audio at the time a player dies.

It syncs with the network from v2.0.0.
And back to totally client side at v2.1.0.
* Network sync is not really needed. You can still choose to hear others' death if you want.

## Configurations

Modify the config file at "BepInEx\config\com.bean.CustomDeathAudio.cfg".

Put your audio into this plugin's folder, or customize the path of your audio relative to this plugin's path.

You can also config the volume and playback speed of your audio.
